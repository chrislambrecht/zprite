Zprite.js
    A simple way to display animated sprites on HTML5 canvas objects.

Usage:
    var targetObj = new Zprite(image, options_object);
    targetObj.draw(); // called during each frame update
    
    options_object requires a number of parameters for successful execution.
        see source for now.
    
    
Better documentation to follow.
